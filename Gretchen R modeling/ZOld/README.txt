The main R file to use is gbdregionalestimates_plotgbd2004_both.r
At the start of the file it is important to change the directory to whatever 
   directory you are using to run and store the results
This R file uses data from several text files included in this code directory.
It also uses several helper R functions which should also be incldued in this
   directory.

hearingloss_gbdregions.xls is an Excel spreadsheet that is slightly 
   modified from the original one that Maya created. The "Original data"
   worksheet contains the original data. The descriptions worksheet 
   provides other information about each study. Most of the other worksheets
   were used for me to do data manipulation to get the data into a form 
   that I could use for the above R function. 

Please just let me know if you have any questions or discover any errors.
